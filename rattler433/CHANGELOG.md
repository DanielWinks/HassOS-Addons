## What’s changed

## 🐛 Bug fixes in 1.7.3

- Fix using customize folder. Mapping was set to read only when it needs to be RW. Should be able to create neccessary folders properly.

## 🎉 New Feature in 1.7.4

- Add support for "UID" temperature, and temperature/humidity devices. Rather than specifying channel + id, specify "uid" in the config.
